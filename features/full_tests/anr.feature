  Scenario: ANR triggered in CXX code is captured
    When I run "CXXAnrScenario"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I tap the screen 3 times
    Then I wait to receive an error
    And the error is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "ANR"
    And the exception "message" starts with " Input dispatching timed out"
    And the error "Bugsnag-Stacktrace-Types" header equals "android,c"
    And the error payload field "events.0.exceptions.0.type" equals "android"
    And the error payload field "events.0.exceptions.0.stacktrace.0.type" equals "c"
    And the error payload field "events.0.threads.0.type" equals "android"
    And the error payload field "events.0.threads.0.stacktrace.0.type" is null

  Scenario: ANR triggered in JVM loop code is captured
    When I clear any error dialogue
    And I run "JvmAnrLoopScenario"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I tap the screen 3 times
    Then I wait to receive an error
    And the error is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier

  Scenario: ANR triggered in JVM sleep code is captured
    When I clear any error dialogue
    And I run "JvmAnrSleepScenario"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I tap the screen 3 times
    Then I wait to receive an error
    And the error is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier

  Scenario: ANR triggered in JVM code is not captured when detectAnrs = false
    When I run "JvmAnrDisabledScenario"
    # No screen taps for this scenario as it seems to break Appium with Android 8
    Then I wait to receive an error
    And the error is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "java.lang.RuntimeException"
    And the exception "message" equals "JvmAnrDisabledScenario"

  Scenario: ANR triggered in JVM code is not captured when outside of release stage
    When I run "JvmAnrOutsideReleaseStagesScenario"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I tap the screen 3 times
    And I wait for 10 seconds
    And I close and relaunch the app after an ANR
    And I configure Bugsnag for "JvmAnrOutsideReleaseStagesScenario"
    Then Bugsnag confirms it has no errors to send
    And I wait for 10 seconds
    #  Wait extra 10 seconds in the end, so appium will have enough time to terminated the previous anr session

  Scenario: ANR not captured with autoDetectAnrs=false
    When I run "AutoDetectAnrsFalseScenario"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I tap the screen 3 times
    And I wait for 10 seconds
    And I close and relaunch the app after an ANR
    And I configure Bugsnag for "AutoDetectAnrsFalseScenario"
    Then Bugsnag confirms it has no errors to send
    And I wait for 10 seconds
    #  Wait extra 10 seconds in the end, so appium will have enough time to terminated the previous anr session

  Scenario: ANR captured with autoDetectAnrs reenabled
    When I clear any error dialogue
    And I run "AutoDetectAnrsTrueScenario"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I tap the screen 3 times
    And I wait to receive an error
